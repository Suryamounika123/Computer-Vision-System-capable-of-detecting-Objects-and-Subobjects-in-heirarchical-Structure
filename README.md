# Computer-Vision-System-capable-of-detecting-Objects-and-Subobjects-in-heirarchical-Structure
This project is an object detection application using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model from  the PyTorch library and OpenCV library. The application reads an image, detects objects in  the image, and prints the detected objects along with their bounding boxes and confidence  scores in JSON format.
